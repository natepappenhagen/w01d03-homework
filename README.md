# Homework

## Setup

1) Get in today's directory in your `funky-ducks` folder.

1.5) From inside of today's directory, Fork this repo and clone it.  

2) (Did you see this coming?) Build our file structure and put your answers in `app.js`.

3) Keep your answers organized! Included a commented header for each section in your answers file.

4) If you're stuck on something for "too long" or get overly frustrated, make a comment and move on. Return to it later.

5) After each section (even if you're not fully done with it), *add* and *commit* your work.

Please use the commit messages that you see at the end of each section (you can modify if necessary).
 We will see these messages on Github. It will help us to see your progress.
  If you go back and fix a section, commit again with an updated message.

7) When you are done with your homework, push and make a pull request.

Final note: You are not alone! Everyone else in the class is working on this as well.
 Communicate with each other on Slack.


## Easy Going
1. Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20.

<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 1 -Easy Going answered"
<hr>

## Get Even
1. Write a for loop that will log only the even numbers in 0 through 200.
>Hint: Think about the increment expression.

<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 2 - Get Even answered"
<hr>

## Excited Kitten
1. Write code that logs "Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!" 20 times.

2. For every **even** number in your loop, log "...human...why you taking pictures of me?...", "...the catnip made me do it...", or "...why does the red dot always get away..." at random.

>Hint: You will need to use Math.random()

## Fizz Buzz

>NOTE: THIS IS A CLASSIC RITE-OF-PASSAGE FOR JAVASCRIPT PROGRAMMERS, ESPECIALLY ONES AT GA

1. Write a javascript application that logs all numbers from 1 - 100.

2. If a number is divisible by 3 log "Fizz" instead of the number.

3. If a number is divisible by 5 log "Buzz" instead of the number.

4. If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 log "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

## Getting to Know You
Use the following arrays to answer the questions below (name, age, hometown):
```
const thom = ["Thom", 1000, "Christchurch"]
const karolin = ["Karolin", 16, "New York"]
const kristyn = ["Kristyn", 5, "Pittsburgh"]
const matt = ["Matt H", 186, "Philadelphia"]
```
1. Matt H. decides that Thom. can't be named "Thom" anymore. Remove "Thom" from the `thom` array and replace it with "Gameboy".

2. Karolin just had her birthday; change Karolin's array to reflect her being a year older.

3. Change Matt H's hometown from Philadelphia to "Gotham City".

4. Remove "Pittsburgh" from Kristyn's array and add "Brooklyn".

<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 5 - Getting to Know You answered"
<hr>

## Yell at the Ninja Turtles
1. Create an array with the members of the ninja turtles (Donatello, Leonardo, Raphael, Michaelangelo)

2. Use a `for loop` to call `toUpperCase()` on each of them and print out the result.

<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 6 - Yell at the Ninja Turtles answered"
<hr>


## Return of the Closets

Below, we've given you examples of Kristyn and Thom's closets modeled as data in JavaScript.
 Use this data to answer the following questions.

```javascript
const kristynsCloset = [
  "left shoe",
  "cowboy boots",
  "right sock",
  "GA hoodie",
  "green pants",
  "yellow knit hat",
  "marshmallow peeps"
];

// Thom's closet is more complicated. Check out this nested data structure!!
const thomsCloset = [
  [
    // These are Thom's shirts
    "grey button-up",
    "dark grey button-up",
    "light blue button-up",
    "blue button-up",
  ],[
    // These are Thom's pants
    "grey jeans",
    "jeans",
    "PJs"
  ],[
    // Thom's accessories
    "wool mittens",
    "wool scarf",
    "raybans"
  ]
];
```

### Alien Attire
1. Kristyn's left shoe has traveled through time and space and turned up in Thom's accessories drawer! Remove Kristyn's shoe from the array and save it to the variable `kristynsShoe`. Use that variable to add Kristyn's lost shoe to Thom's accessories array.

### Dress Us Up
1. Modify your code to put together **3 separate outfits** for Kristyn and Thom. Put the output in a sentence to tell us what we'll be wearing. Mix and match!

<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 7 - Kristyn and Thom have their outfits ready for class - array practice"
<hr>

### Dirty Laundry
Continue looking at the closet arrays:
1. Time to do laundry - loop through Kristyn's closet and log the sentence "WHIRR: Now washing (item)" for each item in the array.

### Inventory
2. Thom wants to do inventory on his closet. Using **bracket notation**, log the arrays containing all of Thom's shirts, pants, and accessories.

<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 8 - I loops through their closets".
<hr>

## Multiples of 3 and 5

_Yes, you might have tackled this earlier, but try it again (don't look back at your other code :eyes:)_

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

:clap: You just solved [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) problem 1! :clap:

# Hungry for more?

## Triangles

0. declare a variable `argument` and set it equal to 7.

1. Write a loop that console logs a "left isosceles" triangle (SEE BELOW) made of '#' that has the height and length of `argument`.

>Ex: argument is 7
```
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

2. Write a loop that console logs a "right isosceles" triangle (SEE BELOW) made of '#' that has the height and length of `argument`.  This is deceptively tricky.

>Ex: argument is 7
```
      #
     ##
    ###
   ####
  #####
 ######
#######
```


3. Write a loop that console logs an "upside down left" isosceles triangle made of '#' that has the height and length of the argument.

>Ex: argument is 7
```
#######
######
#####
####
###
##
#
```

4. Write a loop that console logs an "upside down right" isosceles triangle made of '#' that has the height and length of the argument.  This is also tricky.

>Ex: argument is 7
```
#######
 ######
  #####
   ####
    ###
     ##
      #
```

5. Change the value of argument and reload your code and marvel at how you just solved a challenging problem and feel proud of yourself.

## Find the Median
- Find the median number in the following `nums` array, then console.log that number.
-  _hint_ if you check the length of the array / 2, you might get not get a whole number. In which case, look into `Math.floor( // something )`

```
const nums = [14,11,16,15,13,16,15,17,19,11,12,14,19,11,15,17,11,18,12,17,12,71,18,15,12];

Expected output:
=> 15
```
